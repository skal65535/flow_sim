Small fluid flow simulation prototype in C++

* Used for experimenting fluid flow simulation in C++

This is a toy project with the building blocks for a basic Eulerian flow simulation: 

[advection] -> [add forces] -> [pressure-solver to get a divergence-free flow] -> [advect tracer particles]

I use this as a learning sandbox.
