Fluid flow simulation proto in C++

* Used for experimenting fluid flow simulation in C++

This is a toy project demonstrating the building blocks for any basic
Eulerian flow simulation: advection -> forces -> pressure-solver to get
a divergence-free flow -> advect tracer particles

I use this as a learning sandbox.
